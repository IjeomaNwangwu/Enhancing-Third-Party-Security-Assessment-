# Enhancing-Third-Party-Security-Assessment-
Project Overview:
This project aimed to improve efficiency and consistency in third-party onboarding, monitoring, and offboarding assessments, aligning with the organization's goals and industry best practices.

Project Scope and Objectives:

•	Scope: The project encompassed all aspects of third-party security assessments, from initial onboarding assessments to ongoing monitoring and eventual offboarding assessments.

•	Objectives:
1.	Develop and refine internal operating procedures and SLAs to standardize the assessment process.
2.	Prioritize and assign security assessment requests among team members, accounting for timezones and workloads.
3.	Review, supervise, and approve third-party security assessments to ensure accuracy and consistency.
4.	Optimize the use of industry-leading security tools to automate and streamline assessment tasks.
5.	Collaborate with stakeholders to determine risk tolerance and develop risk mitigation strategies.

Work Accomplished:
1.	Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):
•	Developed a comprehensive set of standardized operating procedures for each phase of the third-party assessment process, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
•	Documented detailed steps, roles and responsibilities, and expected timelines for each assessment type (onboarding, monitoring, offboarding).
2.	SLA Implementation:
•	Established clear SLAs for response times to security assessment requests, ensuring timely completion.
•	Implemented SLA tracking mechanisms to monitor performance and compliance.
3.	Prioritization Framework:
•	Created a prioritization framework that considers factors like the criticality of the third-party relationship, geographic location, and assessment complexity.
•	Developed a dynamic assignment system that allocates assessments to team members based on workload and expertise.
4.	Tool Optimization:
•	Conducted an evaluation of our existing security tools and identified areas for optimization.
•	Implemented automation scripts to expedite routine tasks, reducing manual effort.
5.	Stakeholder Collaboration:
•	Collaborated with legal, procurement, information security, business continuity, privacy, and IT engineering teams to understand their risk tolerance levels.
•	Developed tailored risk mitigation strategies for different business units and third-party relationships.

Results and Impact:

•	Improved Efficiency: The enhanced workflow led to a 30% reduction in the time required for third-party assessments, enabling faster onboarding and risk mitigation.

• Consistency: Standardized procedures and SLAs ensured consistent assessment practices across the organization, reducing variability in assessment outcomes.

•	Enhanced Collaboration: Close collaboration with cross-functional teams resulted in better alignment of risk tolerance and risk mitigation strategies.

•	Executive Presence: Regularly reported on program accomplishments and challenges to executive stakeholders, showcasing transparency and accountability.

Conclusion:
This work sample illustrates my ability to coordinate the enhancement of internal operating procedures, SLAs, and third-party security assessment workflows. It demonstrates my dedication to efficiency, consistency, and collaboration across cross-functional teams, in alignment with the responsibilities outlined in the job posting. The project's success reflects my commitment to delivering results that balance security best practices with business objectives.
